### 前言

   
### **Consul**

We'll be using [Consul](https://www.consul.io/) as a key value store. This will enable things like our network proxy to scale across multiple nodes. Create a new file at *~/work/swarm/consul/docker-compose.yml* with the following contents.

``` yaml
version: '3.1'

services:
  consul:
    image: progrium/consul:latest
    command: -server -bootstrap
    networks:
      - consul
    volumes:
      - consul:/data
    deploy:
      labels:
        - "traefik.enable=false" # This will make sense when we get to the network proxy

networks:
  consul:
    external: true

volumes:
  consul:
    driver: rexray
    driver_opts:
      size: 5 # This is the initial size of the volume to create

```

Now, before we deploy this service we need to provision our swarm with the external network we've specified. You can probably get around with this by using the generated network names that docker stack creates, but I'm not a fan of guess work. Instead, we'll create a network manually (you only need to do this once) by running the following.

``` bash
docker-machine ssh swarm-node-1 "docker network create --driver overlay --attachable consul"
```

Now that the network exists, 我们可以部署 Consul.

``` bash
# Configure the current docker machine to be our swarm manager
eval $(docker-machine env swarm-node-1)

# NOTE: If you are on windows, you will need to run the following in powershell instead
# & "C:\Program Files\Docker\Docker\Resources\bin\docker-machine.exe" env swarm-node-1 | Invoke-Expression

# Deploy Consul to the swarm
docker stack deploy --prune -c ~/work/swarm/consul/docker-compose.yml consul
```

### **Traefik**

Now that we have our key value store up, we can setup our reverse proxy. Before we do, make sure that you have your DNS setup pointing to the node that you want to use for entry (or pointing to multiple nodes via a load balancer). As well, make sure that you have a CNAME record mapping *.example.com to example.com. We'll need that later to allow subdomains to work correctly.

First, we'll create a file to isolate environment variables that we may not want to have in the compose file. Create a file at ~/work/swarm/proxy/.env with the following contents.

``` bash
DO_AUTH_TOKEN=paste-your-digitalocean-token-here

```

Now, let's create our proxy service in a file located at ~/work/swarm/proxy/docker-compose.yml.

``` yaml
version: '3.3'

services:
  proxy:
    image: traefik
    command: -c /traefik.toml
    networks:
      # We need an external proxy network and the consul network
      - proxy
      - consul
    ports:
      # Send HTTP and HTTPS traffic to the proxy service
      - 80:80
      - 443:443
    configs:
      - traefik.toml
    volumes:
      - /var/run/docker.sock:/var/run/docker.sock
    environment:
      - DO_AUTH_TOKEN
    deploy:
      # Deploy the service to all nodes that match our constraints
      mode: global
      placement:
        constraints:
          - "node.role==manager"
          - "node.labels.proxy==true"
      labels:
        # Traefik uses labels to configure routing to your services
        # Change the domain to your own
        - "traefik.frontend.rule=Host:proxy.example.com"
        # Route traffic to the web interface hosted on port 8080 in the container
        - "traefik.port=8080"
        # Name the backend (not required here)
        - "traefik.backend=traefik"
        # Manually set entrypoints (not required here)
        - "traefik.frontend.entryPoints=http,https"

configs:
  # Traefik configuration file
  traefik.toml:
    file: ./traefik.toml

# This service will be using two external networks
networks:
  proxy:
    external: true
  consul:
    external: true

```

>Note: For scalability and in an effort to not overwhelm manager nodes, you can proxy the Docker socket using socat. See #footnotes for an example.

Next, we'll create the config that was referenced in our compose file. Add the file ~/work/swarm/proxy/traefik.toml with the following contents.

``` toml
## If you need to debug things not working, enable the next line
#logLevel = "DEBUG"

# Default to http and https so services don't have to explicitly set entrypoints
# However, it can be a good idea to explicitly set them anyway to avoid bugs later
defaultEntryPoints = ["http", "https"]

# Create entrypoints
[entryPoints]
  # HTTP entrypoint listens on port 80 and will redirect to https
  [entryPoints.http]
  address = ":80"
    [entryPoints.http.redirect]
    entryPoint = "https"
  # HTTPS entrypoint listens on port 443 and will apply tls (via Let's Encrypt)
  [entryPoints.https]
    address = ":443"
      [entryPoints.https.tls]

# Let's Encrypt configuration
[acme]
# Set this to your email
email = "email@example.com"
# This is where traefik stores acme info in Consul
storage = "traefik/acme/account"
# Use the HTTPS entrypoint to handle acme challenges
entryPoint = "https"
# You can never have too many logs
acmeLogging = true

# Configuration for DNS challenges
# This is required in order to get wildcard certs 
[acme.dnsChallenge]
provider = "digitalocean"
delayBeforeCheck = 0

# Configuration for which domains we want certs for
# Change these to your own
[[acme.domains]]
main = "*.example.com" # Receive a wildcard cert
sans = ["example.com"] # Receive a cert for the root domain

## If you want more than one domain, you can add more [[acme.domains]] sections
#[[acme.domains]]
#main = "*.example2.com"
#sans = ["example2.com"]

# Have traefik run its web interface
[web]
address = ":8080"
[web.auth.basic]
  # Add a htpasswd generated username and password here
  # Quick online generator: http://www.htaccesstools.com/htpasswd-generator/
  users = ["username:$hashed$password"]

# Consul configuration
[consul]
  endpoint = "consul:8500"
  watch = true
  prefix = "traefik"

# Docker configuration
[docker]
# Traefik will watch Docker and update its configuration with new rules
endpoint = "unix:///var/run/docker.sock"
# Add your domain here
domain = "example.com"
# Watch Docker
watch = true
# Tell Traefik we are running in swarm mode
swarmmode = true
# Set the default network used for reverse proxy communication
# Adding a service to this network will allow traefik to proxy requests to it
network = "proxy"
# Expose services by default
# This means you need to explicitly disable traefik routing on services you
#  don't want exposed to the outside world with "traefik.enable=false"
exposedbydefault = true

```

Before we can deploy this service, we have laid out two requirements. First, we need an external network named "proxy". Second, we need a node matching the constraints in our compose file (ie. A manager node that has a label "proxy=true"). This can be solved quickly.

``` bash

# Create the proxy network
docker-machine ssh swarm-node-1 "docker network create --driver overlay --attachable proxy"

# Add a label to each node you want your reverse proxy running on
docker-machine ssh swarm-node-1 "docker node update --label-add proxy=true swarm-node-1"

# For example, adding the proxy label to your other manager can be done like so
docker-machine ssh swarm-node-1 "docker node update --label-add proxy=true swarm-node-2"

```

With everything else completed, we can deploy Traefik to the swarm.

``` bash
# If you haven't already, make sure to enable your manager node as the current docker machine
eval $(docker-machine env swarm-node-1)

# NOTE: If you are on windows, you will need to run the following in powershell instead
# & "C:\Program Files\Docker\Docker\Resources\bin\docker-machine.exe" env swarm-node-1 | Invoke-Expression

# Source environment variables for the service
source ~/work/swarm/proxy/.env

# NOTE: If you are on windows, you will have to source your env file differently
# Unless you have git bash installed, in which case that can be used to source the file

# Deploy Traefik to the swarm
docker stack deploy --prune -c ~/work/swarm/proxy/docker-compose.yml proxy

```

Give Traefik a moment to request certs and configure itself, then browse to proxy.example.com and login with your username and password that you hashed earlier.

### Swarmpit

A web interface for swarm management makes life a lot easier when it comes to figuring out what your nodes are doing. Here we'll be using Swarmpit.

Create a new compose file at ~/work/swarm/swarmpit/docker-compose.yml with the following contents.

``` yaml

version: '3.2'

services:
  swarmpit:
    image: swarmpit/swarmpit
    depends_on:
      - couchdb
    volumes:
      - /var/run/docker.sock:/var/run/docker.sock:ro
    environment:
      - SWARMPIT_DB=http://couchdb:5984
    networks:
      - internal
      - proxy
    deploy:
      # Limit resources this service can use
      resources:
        limits:
          cpus: '0.50'
          memory: 1024M
        reservations:
          cpus: '0.25'
          memory: 512M
      placement:
        constraints:
          # Swarmpit must be run on a manager node
          - "node.role==manager"
      labels:
        # Change this to your domain
        - "traefik.frontend.rule=Host:swarm.example.com"
        # Swarmpit hosts its web interface on port 8080 in the container
        - "traefik.port=8080"
        # Name the backend (not required here)
        - "traefik.backend=swarmpit"
        # Manually set entrypoints (not required here)
        - "traefik.frontend.entryPoints=http,https"

  couchdb:
    image: couchdb
    networks:
      - internal
    volumes:
      - couchdb:/opt/couchdb/data
    deploy:
      # Limit resources the database can use
      resources:
        limits:
          cpus: '0.30'
          memory: 512M
        reservations:
          cpus: '0.15'
          memory: 256M
      # Disable traefik routing to this service
      labels:
        - "traefik.enable=false"

  agent:
    image: swarmpit/agent
    environment:
      - DOCKER_API_VERSION=1.35
      # By default, the agent uses the "app" hostname
      # Since we've named our service "swarmpit" we need to remap api urls
      - EVENT_ENDPOINT=http://swarmpit:8080/events
      - HEALTH_CHECK_ENDPOINT=http://swarmpit:8080/version
    networks:
      - internal
    volumes:
      - /var/run/docker.sock:/var/run/docker.sock:ro
    deploy:
      # The agent needs to run on all nodes
      mode: global
      # Limit resources that the agent can use
      resources:
        limits:
          cpus: '0.10'
          memory: 64M
        reservations:
          cpus: '0.05'
          memory: 32M
      # Disable traefik routing to this service
      labels:
        - "traefik.enable=false"

networks:
  # An internal network is used for the server, agents, and database to communicate
  internal:
  # The proxy network is used to send traffic to the server from the outside world
  proxy:
    external:
      name: proxy

volumes:
  # Create a volume for the database
  couchdb:
    driver: rexray
    driver_opts:
      size: 10

```

Swarmpit can now easily be deployed.

``` bash

# If you haven't already, make sure to enable your manager node as the current docker machine
eval $(docker-machine env swarm-node-1)

# NOTE: If you are on windows, you will need to run the following in powershell instead
# & "C:\Program Files\Docker\Docker\Resources\bin\docker-machine.exe" env swarm-node-1 | Invoke-Expression

# Deploy Traefik to the swarm
docker stack deploy --prune -c ~/work/swarm/swarmpit/docker-compose.yml swarmpit
Browse to swarm.example.com and configure your administrator account.

```

### **GitLab**

Here's the big one. GitLab will enable use to use a private Docker Registry and to create a full CI/CD pipeline. Because GitLab is such a massive piece of software, it will take some a few more steps than before to set it up. Let's get started.

Node Resources
Firstly, GitLab uses a lot of resources. You will want to pick one of your droplets that you want GitLab to run on and increase its RAM to at least 3GB. Otherwise the service will run out of memory and crash. To safely do this, perform the following actions.

1. Set the node's availability to "drain" so that services are no longer running.

``` bash
# For example, set swarm-node-3 to drain

docker-machine ssh swarm-node-1 "docker node update --availability drain swarm-node-3"
```

2. On the DigitalOcean interface shutdown the node, increase the size, and turn the node back on.

3. Set the node's availability back to "active" so that services can run again.

``` bash
# For example, set swarm-node-3 to active
docker-machine ssh swarm-node-1 "docker node update --availability active swarm-node-3"

```

### Registry Certs
GitLab uses a set of certificates to communicate with the private Docker Registry that we will setup. To generate those certs, run the following.

``` bash
mkdir ~/work/swarm/gitlab/certs
cd ~/work/swarm/gitlab/certs

openssl req -new -newkey rsa:4096 > registry.csr
openssl rsa -in privkey.pem -out registry.key
openssl x509 -in registry.csr -out registry.crt -req -signkey registry.key -days 10000

# Note: On Windows, OpenSSL may fail. As far as I have found there is no way to
#  successfully create these certificates natively. Instead, I recommend running
#  a Docker image to create them or switching to a linux vm to create the certificates.

```

### Environment Variables

GitLab configuration is mostly done through environment variables. We don't want all of these in the compose file, so we'll create a separate file for them at ~/work/swarm/gitlab/.env with the following contents.

```bash
# Timezone
TZ=America/Los_Angeles

# Registry realm
# Make sure to replace this with your domain
REGISTRY_AUTH_TOKEN_REALM=https://gitlab.example.com/jwt/auth

# URL to the registry, change this to your domain
GITLAB_REGISTRY_HOST=registry.example.com

# Database settings, change at least the password
DB_USER=gitlab
DB_PASS=password
DB_NAME=gitlabhq_production

# URL to GitLab, change this to your domain
GITLAB_HOST=gitlab.example.com

# GitLab secrets, change these
GITLAB_SECRETS_DB_KEY_BASE=long-and-random-alphanumeric-string
GITLAB_SECRETS_SECRET_KEY_BASE=long-and-random-alphanumeric-string
GITLAB_SECRETS_OTP_KEY_BASE=long-and-random-alphanumeric-string

# GitLab email configuration, change these to your email
GITLAB_EMAIL=email@example.com
GITLAB_EMAIL_REPLY_TO=email@example.com
GITLAB_INCOMING_EMAIL_ADDRESS=email@example.com

# GitLab email authentication
# Here's an example of using Gmail authentication
SMTP_ENABLED=true
SMTP_DOMAIN=example.com
SMTP_HOST=smtp.gmail.com
SMTP_PORT=587
SMTP_USER=myemail@gmail.com
SMTP_PASS=mypassword
SMTP_STARTTLS=true
SMTP_AUTHENTICATION=login

```

### Service Creation

Finally, we'll create the compose file and launch our service. Create a new compose file at ~/work/swarm/gitlab/docker-compose.yml with the following contents.

``` yaml
version: '3.2'

services:
  redis:
    restart: always
    image: sameersbn/redis:latest

    deploy:
      placement:
        constraints:
          - "node.labels.gitlab==true"
      labels:
        # Change this to your domain
        - "traefik.frontend.rule=Host:registry.example.com"

```

>Note: This is a long file with a lot of configuration, but don't forget to replace the traefik labels with your domain.

>Note: If you would like to use SSH to clone repositories, you will need to expose the port in the ports section of the GitLab service, set the GITLAB_SSH_PORT environment variable of the GitLab service (ex. GITLAB_SSH_PORT=2222), and then open the port in your firewall with ufw allow 2222/tcp. I recommend port 2222, but you can choose whichever one you prefer.

itLab requires a new external network named "gitlab" which we'll use in a moment to create GitLab runners for the CI/CD pipeline. To create that, run the following.

``` bash
docker-machine ssh swarm-node-1 "docker network create --driver overlay --attachable gitlab"

```

With that, we can now deploy GitLab.

``` bash
# If you haven't already, make sure to enable your manager node as the current docker machine
eval $(docker-machine env swarm-node-1)

# NOTE: If you are on windows, you will need to run the following in powershell instead
# & "C:\Program Files\Docker\Docker\Resources\bin\docker-machine.exe" env swarm-node-1 | Invoke-Expression

# Source environment variables for the service
source ~/work/swarm/gitlab/.env

# NOTE: If you are on windows, you will have to source your env file differently
# Unless you have git bash installed, in which case that can be used to source the file

# Deploy GitLab to the swarm
docker stack deploy --prune -c ~/work/swarm/gitlab/docker-compose.yml gitlab
```

Give GitLab plenty of time to start up and then navigate to registry.example.com and configure the administrator account. Don't worry if GitLab takes a while to start, the first run can be slow while GitLab gets setup.

### Docker Registry

After creating accounts in your GitLab instance, you should be able to log in to your private registry.

``` bash
# Replace this with your domain
# Docker will prompt you for the username and password of your GitLab account
docker login registry.example.com
```

You can now push and pull to and from your registry.

``` bash

# Pull an image from the docker hub
docker pull alpine

# Remember to replace the url with your domain
# Tag an image so it will be associated with your registry
# This will tag your image as "registry.example.com/alpine"
docker tag alpine registry.example.com/alpine

# Remember to replace the url with your domain
# Push the image to your registry
docker push registry.example.com/alpine

```

GitLab Runners

With GitLab setup we can now deploy runners that will execute ci jobs. To do so, you will need two pieces of information from GitLab.

Log in to your GitLab instance and copy the runner registration token to a file at ~/work/swarm/runners/tokens/registration-token.
Log in to your GitLab instance and create a new personal access token for an admin account; copy the token to a file at ~/work/swarm/runners/tokens/personal-access-token.
Now we need to create a new compose file at ~/work/swarm/runners/docker-compose.yml with the following contents. Don't worry, it's not as bad as it looks!

``` yaml
version: '3.1'

services:
  runner:
    image: gitlab/gitlab-runner:latest
    environment:
      - CONCURRENT=8
      - REGISTER_LOCKED=1
      - REGISTER_NON_INTERACTIVE=1
      - RUNNER_EXECUTOR=docker
      - DOCKER_IMAGE=docker
      - DOCKER_VOLUMES=/var/run/docker.sock:/var/run/docker.sock
      - DOCKER_PRIVILEGED=true
      - RUNNER_NAME=docker

      # Replace these URLs with your domain
      - API_URL=https://gitlab.example.com/api/v4
      - CI_SERVER_URL=https://gitlab.example.com/ci
    secrets:
      - registration-token
    entrypoint: "bash"
    command: |
      -c '
