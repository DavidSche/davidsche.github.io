# Docker Networking Workshop

Welcome to the Docker networking workshop! In this session you'll learn about networking in Docker swarm mode and in Kubernetes, using a single Docker Enterprise Edition cluster.

## Contents

The lab is scheduled for 2 hours. You'll start by getting to know the lab environment, and then you'll dig into networking using swarm mode and Kubernetes:

* [Learn to use the Play with Docker lab environment](/pwd.md)

* [Understand Swarm mode networking in Docker EE](/swarm.md)

* [Understand Kubernetes networking in Docker EE](/kube.md)


### Credits

* The swarm part of the lab is adapted from [Nicola Kabar](https://twitter.com/nicolakabar)'s DockerCon 2017 [networking workshop](https://github.com/nicolaka/docker-networking-workshop).

* The Kubernetes network policy demos are adapted from [Calico's documentation](https://docs.projectcalico.org/v3.1/getting-started/kubernetes/tutorials/stars-policy/), which in turn uses [a Mesosphere demo app](https://github.com/projectcalico/star).
