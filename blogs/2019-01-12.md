ASCLAB Micronaut PoC - LAB Insurance Sales Portal
This is an example of a very simplified insurance sales system made in a microservice architecture using Micronaut.

Comprehensive guide describing exactly the architecture, applied design patterns and technologies can be found on our blog in article Building Microservices with Micronaut.

We encourage you to read, because in this README there is only a substitute for all information.
