Set up MySQL master-slave replication in 30 seconds with docker 

### 前言

mysql-replication
A custom mysql docker image with replication enabled, easy and convenient to set up MySQL master-slave replication in 30 seconds.

Introduction
The image is based on official mysql-server with replication enabled for the purpose of learning mysql. Note that this image is for people who want to learn and practice MySQL replication in an easy way.

Environment Variables
SERVER_ID
Make sure every node has a different server id.

REPLICATION_USER
The user name for replication.

REPLICATION_PASSWORD
The password of replication user.

Getting Started
Download the image

docker pull mottox/mysql-replication
Alternatively, you could also clone this repository and build the image locally.

Run master node with

docker run \
--name master \
-e MYSQL_ALLOW_EMPTY_PASSWORD=yes \
-e MYSQL_ROOT_HOST=% \
-e SERVER_ID=1 \
-d mottox/mysql-replication
And then Run slave node with

docker run \
--name slave \
-e MYSQL_ALLOW_EMPTY_PASSWORD=yes \
-e MYSQL_ROOT_HOST=% \
-e SERVER_ID=2 \
-e REPLICATION_MASTER_HOST=master \
--link master:replication   \
-d mottox/mysql-replication
Instead of run the two commands above, you could also copy and use the docker-compose.yml configuration file and run docker-compose up to set up master-slave replication.

### Check if replication is ready

docker exec -it slave mysql -e 'show slave status\G'
The expected Slave_IO_State should be Waiting for master to send event.

### Test replication freely
